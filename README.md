# MyPythonProjects
Here is my project where I made a Music Player using pythons inbuilt libraries and had to install one library "pygame" for audio controls.
For effectively running my code download the entire content from the repo in the same folder and then run the .py file on any compiler of your choice, just make sure you have pygame pre installed (pip install pygame)
